You awake from your long slumber. You had a great nap and you are not sure what time it is, because you are a dog.
However you realize that you were awaken not to the peaceful home you you guard over, but rather a soon to be battle zone between yourself, and the evil squrriels that torment you outside.

What should you do?
1)Go back to Sleep.
2)Run up to the window and bark at the Evil creatures.
