  storyText: "You once again bark valiantly at those cretins, however you are forced
    to stop. You hear your master, your best friend, signal for you to quiet down.
    As you silence yourself, you see the evil squirrels wreck havoc in the backyard
    and begin their reign of terror. You let out a small wimper and cry a single tear
    as you look back at the best friend you failed. You are a bad dog.\r\n\r\nPress
    [Z] to return to checkpoint"
